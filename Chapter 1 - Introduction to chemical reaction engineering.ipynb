    "### 1.1. Reactor design within a chemical process\n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"book\" we aim to understand the chemical reactor, the unit which often finds itself at the heart of chemical engineering processes. Ultimately it is here that we chemically transform species fed into a process to one or more chemically distinct entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we venture to understand these units and the reactions occuring within them, we need to understand a bit about chemical engineering processes and where reactor design fits in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below Fig. 1-1 shows a general block in a process flowsheet. Crossing the border of this block are (1) a feed entering the system, (2) desired products exiting, (3) unconverted reactants exiting, (4) undesired products exiting, and (5) energy transfer (either in or out).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is highly generalized. It may simulate, for example, a full industrial process, a single block within a process, an organism (or part of one), an environmental system. The feeds can therefore include both raw materials and processed materials, the latter of which can be obtained from a previous block or a different process entirely. The intent of this system as a whole may be to (1) convert a lower-cost or lower-demand chemical feedstock to a higher-value or higher-demand product, (2) decompose a harmful material to one which is more benign, or (3) to generate energy and thus power a process or an organism. As such the \"reactor\" can be anything ranging from a formal chemical reactor to an engine to a living cell to a lake. The reactor outlet may then need further processing, including separations and recycle loops. When we design a chemical reactor, we must therefore keep in mind that separations will be a key part in determining how feasible our process is; the reactor alone will not tell us all we need to know.\n",

    "What are we typically asking questions about in chemical reaction engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Chemistry:__ nature of a chemical transformation including the \"mechanism\" and \"pathway\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reaction rates:__ the speed of transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Selectivity:__ the fraction of the feed going to a desired product vs an undesired one\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reactor:__ the basic mode of operation (batch vs continuous), general flow pattern (fully mixed vs plug flow), advanced configurations (e.g., membrane reactors), size, energy requirements, cost, safety\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these can depend heavily on reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the phase of matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we address these questions? The \"toolkit\" we use includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Material balances\n",
    "- Rate expressions from mechanisms and experimental data\n",
    "- Thermodynamics (e.g., chemical equilibrium)\n",
    "- Energy balances\n",
    "- Mass transport equations\n",
    "\n",
    "What time scales are we typically operating in? Generally we will have to consider one or more vastly different time scales at a time ranging from the very short (bond breaking events on the order of picoseconds) to the very long (industrial processes on the order of days to years). These are generally summarized below in Fig. 1.2.\n",

    "### 1.4. Why we care\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of motivations for chemical reactor design, but we can list a few examples below:\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Sustainability__: Improving reactor designs can lead to lower energy consumption and lessened pollution. The purpose of many reactors is in fact solely to mitigate pollution (such as the catalytic converter in cars). Furthermore, designing novel reactors, processes, and catalysts to accelerate reactions, we can enable the use of more sustainable feedstocks than many of the non-renewable ones we rely upon today.\n",
    " - __Health__: By understanding the chemical reactions occuring in humans, animals, and nature, we can develop therapies to improve health and wellness.\n",
    " - __Profit__: Small improvements in reactor design can translate to large changes in process economics, in part because we may be designing very large scale processes. Whatever your motivation, profit will inevitably be a major driving force in your efforts. Ultimately money will talk, so if you care about sustainability or health your challenge will be to develop technologies which address these areas while also generating a profit.\n",
